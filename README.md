Hello, my name is Anirudh Konidala and
I am a freshmen studying both Computer Science and Education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign!
I enjoy delving into the field of digital learning software, where I am actively
creating content online online to guide many people in learning the important skill of programming!

Hello, my name is Anirudh Konidala and
I am a freshmen studying both Computer Science and Education at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign!

I enjoy integrating AI and ML into the field of educational technology, where I actively
creating content online to guide many people
in learning the important skill of programming using ML based tutors to create
various personalized virtual tutors to help students learn at their own pace
